# disease_prediction-using-machine-learning

This system helps in predicting the disease when symptoms are given. Here we propose a system that allows users to get instant knowledge on their health issues through this intelligent health care system. The system is fed with various symptoms and the disease associated with those symptoms. The system allows users to share their symptoms.
